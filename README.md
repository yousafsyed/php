This is the Git repo of the Docker [unofficial image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yousaf/php/) for [php](https://hub.docker.com/r/yousaf/php/). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/yousaf/php/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

Official docker library for php does not support some of the popular base images for linux distros like (Ubuntu, Centos) which are sometimes required by different developers and companies according to there needs.

This repository aims to solve that problem by actively supporting unsupported linux distros.
